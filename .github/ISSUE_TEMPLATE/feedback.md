Alternatively, email data to <analyzer@engflow.com> while referencing the
created issue, or opt to send the feedback entirely by email.

attach a text file.

### File(s) scanned

Optionally attach the Bazel profile(s) that were analyzed by the Bazel Invocation Analyzer.

Ideally, do not attach files directly. Bazel profiles can include sensitive data, such as exposing
which dependencies your project includes.

Instead, upload files to the cloud storage provider of your choice and grant appropriate access.
This allows you to adjust who can access them now and in the future. For example, you may want to
remove access to the files once the issue has been resolved.
