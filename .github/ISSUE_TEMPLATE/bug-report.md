### File(s) scanned

Optionally provide file(s) that demonstrate the bug when running the tool.

Ideally, do not attach files directly. Bazel profiles can include sensitive data, such as exposing
which dependencies your project includes.

Instead, upload files to the cloud storage provider of your choice and grant appropriate access.
This allows you to adjust who can access them now and in the future. For example, you may want to
remove access to the files once the issue has been resolved.
